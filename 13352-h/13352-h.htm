    <h2>MR. PUNCH'S POCKET IBSEN.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Condensed and Revised Version, by Mr. P.'s Own Harmless
    Ibsenite.</i>)</h4>

    <h3>No. IV.&mdash;THE WILD DUCK.</h3>

    <h4>ACT I.</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>At</i> WERLE's <i>house. In front a
        richly-upholstered study</i>. (R.) <i>a green-baize door
        leading to</i> WERLE's <i>office. At back, open folding
        doors, revealing an elegant dining-room, in which a
        brilliant Norwegian dinner-party is going on. Hired Waiters
        in profusion. A glass is tapped with a knife. Shouts of
        "Bravo!"</i> Old Mr. WERLE <i>is heard making a long
        speech, proposing&mdash;according to the custom of
        Norwegian society on such occasions&mdash;the health of his
        Housekeeper</i>, Mrs. SÖRBY. <i>Presently several
        short-sighted, flabby, and thin-haired</i> Chamberlains,
        <i>enter from the dining-room, with</i> HIALMAR EKDAL,
        <i>who writhes shyly under their remarks.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>A Chamberlain</i>. As we are the sole surviving specimens
    of Norwegian nobility, suppose we sustain our reputation as
    aristocratic sparklers by enlarging upon the enormous amount we
    have eaten, and chaffing HIALMAR EKDAL, the friend of our
    host's son, for being a professional Photographer?</p>

    <div class="figright"

        <a href="images/241.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="'Father, a word with you in private. I loathe you!'" />
        </a>"Father, a word with you in private. I loathe you!"
    </div>

    <p><i>The other Chamberlains</i>. Bravo! We will.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>They do; delight of</i> HIALMAR. Old WERLE <i>comes
        in, leaning on his</i> Housekeeper's <i>arm, followed by
        his son</i>, GREGERS WERLE.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Old Werle</i> (<i>dejectedly</i>). Thirteen at table!
    (<i>To</i> GREGERS, <i>with a meaning glance at</i> HIALMAR.)
    This is the result of inviting an old College friend who has
    turned Photographer! Wasting vintage wines on <i>him</i>,
    indeed!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He passes on gloomily.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Hialmar</i> (<i>to Gregers</i>). I am almost sorry I
    came. Your old min is <i>not</i> friendly. Yet he set me up as
    a Photographer fifteen years ago. <i>Now</i> he takes me down!
    But for him, I should never have married GINA, who, you may
    remember, was a servant in your family once.</p>

    <p><i>Gregers</i>. What? my old College friend married fifteen
    years ago&mdash;and to our GINA, of all people! If I had not
    been up at the works all these years, I suppose I should have
    heard something of such an event. But my father never mentioned
    it. Odd!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He ponders</i>; Old EKDAL <i>comes out through the
        green-baize door, bowing, and begging pardon, carrying
        copying work.</i> Old WERLE <i>says "Ugh" and "Puh"
        involuntarily.</i> HIALMAR <i>shrinks back, and looks
        another way. A</i> Chamberlain <i>asks him pleasantly if he
        knows that old man.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Hialmar</i>. I&mdash;oh no. Not in the least. No
    relation!</p>

    <p><i>Gregers</i> (<i>shocked</i>). What, HIALMAR, you, with
    your great soul, deny your own father!</p>

    <p><i>Hialmar</i> (<i>vehemently</i>). Of course&mdash;what
    else <i>can</i> a Photographer do with a disreputable old
    parent, who has been in a Penitentiary for making a fraudulent
    map? I shall leave this splendid banquet. The Chamberlains are
    not kind to me, and I feel the crushing hand of fate on my
    head! [<i>Goes out hastily, feeling it.</i></p>

    <p><i>Mrs. Sörby</i> (<i>archly</i>). Any Nobleman here say
    "Cold Punch"?</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Every Nobleman says "Cold Punch," and follows her
        out in search of it with enthusiasm</i>. GREGERS
        <i>approaches his father, who wishes he would go.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Gregers</i>. Father, a word with you in private. I loathe
    you. I am nothing if not candid. Old EKDAL was your partner
    once, and it's my firm belief you deserved a prison quite as
    much as he did. However, you surely need not have married our
    GINA to my old friend HIALMAR. You know very well she was no
    better than she should have been!</p>

    <p><i>Old Werle</i>. True&mdash;but then no more is Mrs. SÖRBY.
    And <i>I</i> am going to marry <i>her</i>&mdash;if you have no
    objection, that is.</p>

    <p><i>Gregers</i>. None in the world! How can I object to a
    stepmother who is playing Blind Man's Buff at the present
    moment with the Norwegian nobility? I am not so overstrained as
    all that. But really I can<i>not</i> allow my old friend
    HIALMAR, with his great, confiding, childlike mind, to remain
    in contented ignorance of GINA's past. No, I see my mission in
    life at last! I shall take my hat, and inform him that his home
    is built upon a lie. He will be <i>so</i> much obliged to me!
    [<i>Takes his hat, and goes out.</i></p>

    <p><i>Old Werle</i>. Ha!&mdash;I am a wealthy merchant, of
    dubious morals, and I am about to marry my housekeeper, who is
    on intimate terms with the Norwegian aristocracy. I have a son
    who loathes me, and who is either an Ibsenian satire on the
    Master's own ideals, or else an utterly impossible prig&mdash;I
    don't know or care which. Altogether, I flatter myself my
    household affords an accurate and realistic picture of
    Scandinavian Society!</p>

    <h4>ACT II.</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p>HIALMAR EKDAL's <i>Photographic Studio. Cameras,
        neck-rests, and other instruments of torture lying
        about</i>. GINA EKDAL <i>and</i> HEDWIG, <i>her daughter,
        aged 14, and wearing spectacles, discovered sitting up
        for</i> HIALMAR.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Hedvig</i>. Grandpapa is in his room with a bottle of
    brandy and a jug of hot water, doing some fresh copying work.
    Father is in society, dining out. He promised he would bring me
    home something nice!</p>

    <p><i>Hialmar</i> (<i>coming in, in evening dress</i>). And he
    has not forgotten his promise, my child. Behold! (<i>he
    presents her with the menu card</i>; HEDVIG <i>gulps down her
    tears</i>; HIALMAR <i>notices her disappointment, with
    annoyance.</i>) And this all the gratitude I get! After dining
    out and coming home in a dress-coat and boots, which are
    disgracefully tight! Well, well, just to show you how hurt I
    am, I won't have any <i>beer</i> now! What a selfish brute I
    am! (<i>Relenting.</i>) You may bring me just a little drop.
    (<i>He bursts into tears.</i>) I will play you a plaintive
    Bohemian dance on my flute. (<i>He does.</i>) No beer at such a
    sacred moment as this! (<i>He drinks.</i>) Ha, this is real
    domestic bliss!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[GREGERS WERLE <i>comes in, in a countrified
        suit.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Gregers</i>. I have left my father's
    home&mdash;dinner-party and all&mdash;for ever. I am coming to
    lodge with you.</p>

    <p><i>Hialmar</i> (<i>still melancholy</i>). Have some bread
    and butter. You won't? then I <i>will</i>. I want it, after
    your father's lavish hospitality. (HEDVIG <i>goes to fetch
    bread and butter.</i>) My daughter&mdash;a poor shortsighted
    little thing&mdash;but mine own.</p>

    <p><i>Gregers</i>. My father has had to take to strong glasses,
    too&mdash;he can hardly see after dinner. (<i>To</i> Old EKDAL,
    <i>who stumbles in very drunk.</i>) How can you, Lieutenant
    EKDAL, who were such a keen sportsman once, live in this poky
    little hole?</p>

    <p><i>Old Ekdal</i>. I am a sportsman still. The only
    difference is that once I shot bears in a forest, and now I pot
    tame rabbits in a garret. Quite as amusing&mdash;and safer.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He goes to sleep on a sofa.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Hialmar</i> (<i>with pride</i>). It is quite true. You
    shall see.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He pushes back sliding doors, and reveals a garret
        full of rabbits and poultry&mdash;moonlight effect.</i>
        HEDVIG <i>returns with bread and butter.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Hedvig</i> (<i>to</i> GREGERS). If you stand just there,
    you get the best view of our Wild Duck. We are very proud of
    her, because she gives the play its title, you know, and has to
    be brought into the dialogue a good deal. Your father, peppered
    her out shooting, and we saved her life.</p>

    <p><i>Hialmar</i>. Yes, GREGERS, our estate is not
    large&mdash;but still we preserve, you see. And my poor old
    father and I sometimes get a day's gunning in the garret. He
    shoots with a pistol, which my illiterate wife here <i>will</i>
    call a "pigstol." He once, when he got into trouble, pointed it
    at himself. But the descendant of two lieutenant-colonels who
    had never quailed before living rabbit yet, faltered then. He
    <i>didn't</i> shoot. Then I put it to my own head. But at the
    decisive moment, I won the victory over myself. I remained in
    life. Now we only shoot rabbits and fowls with it. After all I
    am very happy and contented as I am. [<i>He eats some bread and
    butter.</i></p>

    <p><i>Gregers</i>. But you ought <i>not</i> to be. You have a
    good deal of the Wild Duck about you. So have your wife and
    daughter. You are living in marsh vapours. To-morrow I will
    take you out for a walk and explain what I mean. It is my
    mission in life. Good night! [<i>He goes out.</i></p>

    <p><i>Gina and Hedwig</i>. What <i>was</i> the gentleman
    talking about, Father?</p>

    <p><i>Hialmar</i> (<i>eating bread and butter</i>). He has been
    dining, you know. No matter&mdash;what <i>we</i> have to do
    now, is to put my disreputable old whitehaired pariah of a
    parent to bed.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He and</i> GINA <i>lift old</i> ECCLES<i>&mdash;we
        mean old</i> EKDAL&mdash;<i>up by the legs and arms, and
        take him off to led as the Curtain falls.</i></p>

    <h2>FAMILIARITY BREEDS RESPECT.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A page from the Diary of a would-be but couldn't-be
    Duellist.</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>Monday</i>.&mdash;Arrived on the ground ready to fight my
    opponent to the death. We had just measured the ground, when an
    agent of Police appeared upon the scene, and we had to decamp
    hurriedly. Duel postponed till to-morrow.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;New spot chosen. Pistols this time
    instead of rapiers. Just as we were about to fire, appearance
    of the agents of the law. Postponement again absolutely
    necessary.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;Once more ready to meet. Both of us
    rather amused at the precautions we have to take to prevent
    interruption. Opponent obligingly suggested a new and suitable
    spot for the settlement of our little differences. Found it to
    be a most excellent selection, but before we could fight, once
    more interrupted. Both of us greatly annoyed, and arranged to
    meet to-morrow.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;Amused to find myself first in the
    field&mdash;my opponent five minutes late. Both of us had come
    before the seconds, and so spent the time in a pleasant little
    chat, and cigarettes. My opponent not half a bad fellow when
    you come to know him. Just as he was in the middle of a most
    amusing story, our seconds arrived&mdash;with the Police!
    Postponement once more imperative.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Opponent turned up first, and, at my
    request, completed his yesterday's story&mdash;one of the best
    I have ever heard. Most amusing chap&mdash;should have liked to
    have heard another, when, finding ourselves uninterrupted, we
    thought we had better seize the opportunity to settle our
    affair of honour. Our customary luck! Seemingly had just time
    to kill one another, when enter the Police! Programme as
    before.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday</i>.&mdash;Met again. Really quite pleased to
    have made the acquaintance of such a nice fellow as my
    opponent. Full of fun and anecdote. On comparing notes, we
    found that we had entirely forgotten what on earth we had
    quarrelled about. So shook hands and arranged that if we fired
    at anyone, our target should be the Police.</p>

    <h3>A PLEA FOR THE CART-HORSE PARADE SOCIETY.</h3>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>All who love English horses, and back English
            Trade,</p>

            <p>Should welcome the annual "Cart-Horse Parade."</p>

            <p>No function of Fashion on Racecourse or Row</p>

            <p>Should "fetch" our equestrian enthusiast so.</p>

            <p>First-rate English horses in holiday guise!</p>

            <p>A sight that to please a true Britisher's eyes.</p>

            <p>And then the Society&mdash;surely <i>that</i> will
            be</p>

            <p>Supported by Britons. Ask good WALTER GILBEY</p>

            <p>(Cambridge House, Regent's Park). He will tell you
            no doubt</p>

            <p>What the C.-H.P.S. have, some time, been about.</p>

            <p>Fancy prizes to Carmen for care of their horses!</p>

            <p>That charms a horse-lover. To plump the
            resources</p>

            <p>Of such a Society&mdash;by their support</p>

            <p>In subscriptions&mdash;all friends of the horse and
            of sport</p>

            <p>Should surely be eager; so, horse-lovers
            willing,</p>

            <p>Despatch the gold pound plus the odd silver
            shilling!</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <hr />

    <p>HISTORY AND ART.&mdash;Doubts have been thrown on the
    genuineness of the story about St. ELIZABETH of Hungary as
    illustrated by Mr. CALDERON's well-known and striking picture
    in this year's Academy. Mr. CALDERON affirms, according to the
    best of his high lights, that he has simply portrayed the naked
    truth. So far, in a certain sense, the Court is with him.
    Still, historians are neither unbiassed nor infallible, and
    painters are inclined to sacrifice much for effect. For our
    part, we should be inclined to refer the situation, which this
    picture illustrates, to some incident in the life of the
    celebrated Miss ELIZABETH MARTIN, generally known as "BETTY
    MARTIN." The legend may be found in some work by that
    voluminous writer <i>Finis</i>, or by the oft-quoted
    <i>Ibid</i>, under the quaint heading, <i>Historia Mei et Beati
    Martini</i>.</p>

    <p>Fate, that makes sport alike of peasants and of kings,
    turning the one to honour and a high seat, and making the other
    to lie low in the estimation of men, though haply (as 'tis said
    in our parish) he think no small beer of himself, hath
    seemingly ordained that I, THOMAS TIDDLER, should set down in
    order some doings wherein I had a share. And herein I make no
    show of learning, being but an undoctrined farmer and not
    skilled in the tricks of style, as the word is in these parts,
    but trusting simply to strength and honesty (whereof, God
    knows, there is but little beyond the limits of our farm), and
    to that breezy carriage of the pen which favoureth a plain man
    treading sturdily the winding paths and rough places of his
    native tongue. Notwithstanding I take no small encouragement
    from this, that whereas of those that have made to my knowledge
    the bravest boasting and the loudest puffing (though of this I
    am loth to speak, never having had a stomach for the work), the
    writings often perish neglectfully and nothing said, some,
    writing afar in quiet places removed from the busy rabblement
    of towns, not seldom steer their course to fame and riches,
    whereof, thanks be to Heaven, I never yet had covetousness,
    deeming theirs the happier lot to whom a dry crust with haply a
    slice of our good country cheese and a draught of the foaming
    cider bring contentment. Each to his own fashion, say I, and
    the fashion of the TIDDLERS hath always been in a manner plain
    and unvarnished, like to the large oak press wherein mother
    stores her Sunday gown and other woman's finery such as the
    mind of man, being at best but a coarse week-day creature, hath
    never fairly conceived. But lo! I am tarrying on my way, losing
    myself in a maze of cheap fancies, while the reader perchance
    yawns and stretches his limbs as though for bed. All I know is
    paper and ink are cheaper than when I began to write.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

    <p>Now it fell on a Summer morning, I being then but newly come
    home from the Farmers' College, in the ancient town of
    Cambridge, that our whole household was gathered together in
    our parlour. Mother sat by the head of the great table, ladling
    out a savoury mess of porridge, not rashly, as the custom of
    some is, but carefully, like a prudent housewife, guarding her
    own. And by her side sat MOLLY and BETTY, her daughters, and
    next to them the maids, and they that pertained to the work of
    the house. First came old POLLY THISTLEDEW, gaunt of face, and
    parched of skin, the wrinkles running athwart her face, and
    over her hooked nose, like to the rivers drawn with much labour
    of meandering pen in the schoolboys' maps, though for such my
    marks were always low, I being better skilled in the giving of
    raps with the closed fist than in the making of maps with inky
    fingers&mdash;a bootless toil, as it always hath seemed to me.
    Next to her sat SALLY, the little milkmaid, casting coy glances
    at mother, who would have none of them, but with undue
    sternness, as I thought then, and still think, tossed them back
    to the shame-faced SALLY. Lower down sat JOHN TOOKER, "GIRT JAN
    DOUBLEFACE" he was ever called, not without a sly hint of
    increasing obesity, for JOHN, though a mighty man of thews and
    sinews, was no small trencherman, and, as the phrase is, did
    himself right royally whenever porridge was in question. All
    these sat, peaceably swallowing, while I, at the table's foot,
    faced mother, stirring my steaming bowl with my forefinger,
    forgetting the heat thereof, but not daring to wince, lest
    BETTY, whose tongue cut shrewdly when she had a mind, should
    make sport of me.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

    <p>Although I had, for the most part, so very stout an appetite
    that my bowl stood always first for the refilling, I had no
    desire for my food that day, but idly sat and stirred, and the
    burden of my thoughts wore deeply inward with the dwelling of
    my mind on this view and on that of it. But, on a sudden, what
    a turmoil, what a rising of maids, what a jumping on chairs,
    what a drawing up of gowns, and what a scurrying! For, out of a
    corner, comes the great brown rat, gliding sedately, and never
    so much as asking by your leave or with your leave. Then
    mother's old tom-cat, <i>Trouncer</i>, slowly rising, stretches
    his limbs, and bares his claws, making ready for what is to
    come, but not, me-thinks, with much alacrity for the conflict,
    for rats have teeth, as <i>Trouncer</i> knows&mdash;ay, and can
    use them to much purpose. Therefore <i>Trouncer</i>, making
    belief to be brave, as is the custom both of cats and of others
    that walk on two legs, and have thumbs to their fore-paws,
    gathers himself to the spring, but springs not. Then comes GIRT
    JAN's terrier, <i>Rouser</i>, at last&mdash;where hath the
    terrier been tarrying? Terriers should not tarry&mdash;and,
    with scant ceremony, leaps upon <i>Trouncer</i>. Cuff, cuff, go
    the claws. <i>Trouncer</i> swears roundly. Nay,
    <i>Trouncer</i>, 'tis a coward's part to fly beneath the chair.
    To him, good <i>Rouser</i>, to him, my man. But <i>Rouser</i>
    hath forgot the claw-bearer, though his bleeding nose for many
    a day shall remember. <i>Rouser</i> hath the rat in view. Round
    the parlour they go, helter-skelter, <i>Rouser</i> on the
    tracks of the life-desiring rat, while the maids upon the
    chairs show ankles, in proof of terror, until, lo! he hath him
    pinned fast, never more to stir, or clean his whiskers in
    rat-land.</p>

    <p>And then all come down, and JAN boasts loudly how he all but
    trod him flat, ay, and could have done so had rat not fled in
    terror of his boot; and <i>Trouncer</i> returns, smugly
    purring, and mother rates the blushing maids.</p>

    <p>And I to the fields, having work to do, but liking not the
    doing.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

    <p>Now I with <i>Rouser</i> at my heels went manfully on my
    way. Gaily I went over the parched brown wastes where lately
    the flood had lain heavy upon the land, past the whispering
    copses of fir and beech and oak that top the upland, through
    the yellowing corn that stands waving golden promise in the
    valley, till I came to where the land bends suddenly with a
    sharp turn from the eastward whence a pearly brook, now swollen
    to a roaring torrent, babbles bravely over the stones. Sudden I
    stopped as though a palsy had gripped me, though of the
    TIDDLERS, as is well known, none hath ever suffered of a palsy,
    they being for the most part a lusty race, and apt for enduring
    moisture both within and without. Never till my dying day shall
    I forget the sight that met my eyes. For there seated upon a
    tuffet, her beautiful blue eyes fixed in horror and despair,
    her jug of curds and whey scarce tasted, was my MARIAN, while
    beside her, lolling at ease with the slothful stretch of his
    great limbs, and the flames as of Tophet in his fierce eyes sat
    SPIDER, the great black-haired giant SPIDER that would make a
    feast of her.</p>

    <p>I know not how I ran, nor what mighty strength was in my
    limbs, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page245"
       id="page245"></a>[pg 245]</span> but in a moment I was with
       them, and his hairy throat was in my clutch. Quickly he
       turned upon me and fain had freed himself. Our breast-bones
       cracked in the conflict, his arms wound round and round me,
       and a hideous gleam of triumph was in his face. Thrice he
       had me off my feet, but at the fourth close I swayed him to
       the right, and then with one last heave I flung him on his
       back, and had the end of it, leaving him dead and flattened
       where he lay.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>

    <p>Then gently I bore my MARIAN home, and mother greeted her
    fondly, saying, "Miss MUFFET, I presume?" which pleased me,
    thinking it only right that mother should use ceremony with my
    love. But she, poor darling, lay quiet and pale, scarce knowing
    her own happiness or the issue of the fight. For 'tis the way
    of women ever to faint if the occasion serve and a man's arms
    be there to prop them. And often in the warm summer-time, when
    the little lads and lasses gather to the plucking of buttercups
    and daisies, likening them gleefully to the gold and silver of
    a rich man's coffers, my darling, now grown matronly, sitteth
    on the tuffet in their midst, and telleth the tale of giant
    SPIDER and his fate.&mdash;[THE END.]</p>

    <p>One of our "Co."&mdash;and the Baron may observe that, when
    "Co." is written it is not an abbreviation of "Coves"&mdash;has
    been reading <i>Sir George</i> (BENTLEY), a Novel, which Mrs.
    HENNIKER has the courage to put forth in one volume. At the
    outset, the writing is a little slipshod. Mrs. HENNIKER has,
    moreover, a wild passion for the conjunction. When she can't
    summon another "which," she sticks in a "that." On one page
    appears the following startling announcement&mdash;"The March
    winds this year were unusually biting, and her nervous guardian
    would therefore [why therefore?] never allow her to walk out
    without a respirator, till they blew no longer from the East."
    We assume that, as soon as respirators blew from the West, this
    injunction would be withdrawn. But, as Mrs. HENNIKER, gets
    forward in her story, the style improves, "which's" disappear
    as they did in <i>Macbeth's</i> time, and the tale is told in
    simple strenuous language. <i>Uncle George</i> is a character
    finely conceived, and admirably drawn.</p>

    <p>The Baron returns thanks to the publisher, W. HEINEMANN, for
    sending a volume of DE QUINCEY's <i>Posthumorous Works</i>. A
    small dose of them, taken occasionally the last thing at night,

    <h2>EVENINGS FROM HOME.</h2>

    <p>At the Court Theatre, <i>Le Feu Toupinel</i>, adapted for
    the English stage as <i>The Late Lamented</i>, is decidedly
    funny, that is, if you can once get over the idea that all its
    humour depends upon the immoral vagaries of an elderly
    scoundrel, an habitual criminal, who has departed this life in
    the odour of respectability, without his immoralities ever
    having been discovered. Had he been found out during his
    lifetime, he would have been tried for bigamy, convicted, and
    punished accordingly. This piece has been adapted from the
    French for the English stage; but, query, is it adapted to an
    English audience? That's the point. The run must decide. If the
    best possible acting can carry it along, then that it has got;
    for, though Mrs. JOHN WOOD has frequently had better chances,
    yet she has never worked harder, and never has she more
    deserved the laughter she excites. The same may be said of Mr.
    STANDING and Miss FILLIPPI, and also of Mr. ARTHUR CECIL, whose
    make-up is perfect, especially the dressing and colouring of
    his hair, which is an artistic triumph. Mr. GILBERT FARQUHAR's
    <i>Mr. Fawcett</i>, the Solicitor, contributes much to the fun
    of the scenes in which he appears with Mrs. JOHN WOOD; and Mr.
    CAPE, as <i>Parker</i>, the Confidential Servant, is excellent.
    There's plenty of "go" in it, but will it "stay"?</p>

    <p>Great attraction at the Lyceum! <i>The Corsican Brothers</i>
    and <i>Nance Oldfield</i>! ELLEN TERRY as <i>Nance</i> is
    delightful. Chorus, Gentlemen, if you please,
    "<i>For</i>&mdash;all our fancy, Dwells upon Nancy!" Our ELLEN
    is charming in this, so natural and so theatrical: herself as
    <i>Nance</i>, and then as <i>Mrs. Oldfield</i>, the actress, in
    the characters that <i>Nance</i> assumes. For 'tis ELLEN
    playing <i>Nancy</i>, and <i>Nancy</i> again playing Tragedy
    and Comedy. It is an old piece revived: there never was so old
    a piece, for there are only four characters in it, and they're
    all Old. There are two <i>Oldfields</i> and two
    <i>Oldworthys</i>. Mr. WENMAN as <i>Oldfield Senior</i>, or the
    Old Obadiah, is a trifle too blusterous, but on the other hand,
    I am not prepared to say that a country attorney of that period
    wouldn't be uncouth and blusterous. His son <i>Alexander</i>,
    the Young Obadiah, is prettily played by Mr. GORDON CRAIG, who
    is a trifle too windmilly with his hands and arms; but in the
    whole play nothing becomes him so well as the pathos of his
    broken-hearted exit. He was touching and going. Henceforth,
    this young actor may justly describe himself as of the
    "Touch-and-go" school, and be, like "the livin' skeleton"
    mentioned by <i>Sam Weller</i>, "proud o' the title." Miss KATE
    PHILLIPS as <i>Anne's</i> sister&mdash;though, as Mr. J.L. T-LE
    observed, as she is younger than <i>Anne</i>, she cannot well
    be her Anne-sister&mdash;is as bright and lively as need be,
    considering her menial position, which is rather odd in her
    sister's house. Visit Mistress NANCE TERRY; you'll find her
    very much "at home" in the part. After which <i>The Corsican
    Brothers</i> revived, Ghost and all.</p>

    <p>When some years ago the Irvingesque version of it was
    produced, the twin who lived in Corsica, Brother <i>Fabien</i>,
    used to behave in the wildest Corsican way. Who that saw it
    some years ago does not remember how he used to chuck his gun
    up in the air, when it caught on to a hook in the wall! with
    what gusto he used to light a tiny cigarette from an enormous
    flaming brand snatched from the burning wood fire on the
    hearth! and how badly the starving guest from Paris fared in
    the Corsican household where he hadn't a chance against the
    appetite of Master <i>Fabien</i>, who, after a hard day's
    sport, came in ready for anything, and ate everything! It was
    the only occasion when this fearless son of destiny ever
    "bolted." But, my! how the food used to disappear! what a short
    time the supper occupied, and how very much third best the poor
    stranger came off under the hospitable roof of the <i>Dei
    Franchis</i>. Even now the supper is a brief one, but justice
    is done to it, <i>and</i> to the weary traveller. Never was
    such an unhappy tourist! He comes to a house in the wilds of
    Corsica; he is choke-full of Parisian gossip, he has a lot to
    say of course, but he never gets a chance, as <i>Fabien</i>
    tells him family stories one after the other, as if he hadn't
    had such an opportunity or so good a listener for ever so long.
    Then, when on the entrance of his mother <i>Fabien</i> breaks
    off in the middle of one of his many anecdotes, which evidently
    can't be told before ladies, the Parisian gent, who now sees
    something like an opening for some light Boulevardian
    chit-chat, is presented with a flat candlestick and bowed off
    to bed, without being allowed a word to say for himself. All
    this is just the same as ever; there have been no alterations
    nor repairs; the piece is as curiously old-fashioned as are the
    exquisitely correct costumes; while the Masked Ball at the
    Opera and the Duel in the snow are as effective as ever, and
    the latter, if anything, more so. They make a first-rate fight
    of it, do Messrs. <i>Irving dei Franchi</i> and <i>M. Terriss
    de Château Renaud</i>, until the latter collapses, and
    "subsequent proceedings interested him no more." As long as the
    strong right arm of the Corsican Brother can draw a good and
    shining rapier, he will draw as good and brilliant a house as
    he did on the first night of this revival. Why ought this piece
    to go well in the first theatre in Ireland? Why? because it's a
    great play for Doublin'. <i>Exeunt omnes.</i></p>

            have strayed till I'm all of a pant, Sir.</p>

            <p>Twelve months ago we started, you know, and I've
            been on my feet ever since, Sir.</p>

            <p>And oh, if you please, I feel weak at the knees, and
            the pains in my back make me wince, Sir.</p>

            <p>Mister HOOD's "Lost Child" wasn't half as had, for
            he only strayed in the gutter,</p>

            <p>While this dreadful Maze is enough to craze; and
            <i>my</i> feeling of lostness is utter.</p>

            <p>Oh, my poor feet! This is worse than Crete, and old
            Hampton Court isn't in it.</p>

            <p>Oh stop, <i>do</i> stop! for I feel I shall drop if
            I don't sit down half a minute.</p>

            <p>How LABBY will laugh at the Labyrinth-maker, who
            gets lost in his own Great Maze, Sir!</p>

            Sir.</p>

            <p>You won't be hurried, and you can't be flurried, and
            you're always as cool as a cucumber.</p>

            <p>Can a little 'un like me, your own child, don't you
            see, such a smart pioneer as are <i>you</i> cumber?</p>

            <p>You, the modern Theseus? Where's your Ariadne? Oh, I
            know you are cool, and clever.</p>

            <p>Yet I feel a doubt. When <i>shall</i> we get

    <h3>Change for Thirty-Five Shillings.</h3>

    <p>There is a singular directness of purpose in the following
    advertisement which appears in the <i>Daily
    News</i>:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>REPORTER (27), now on Weekly, WANTS CHANGE.
        35<i>s.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The advertiser not only wants change, but he mentions the
    exact sum. It seems odd. One often wants change for a
    sovereign, and even oftener wants the sovereign itself. But
    what precise coin a man hands you when he wants thirty-five
    shillings change is not quite clear.</p>

    <h2>LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.</h2>

    <p><i>Billsbury, May 5</i>.&mdash;Received the following letter
    from TOLLAND yesterday:&mdash;</p>

    <p class="author">45, <i>Main Street, Billsbury, May 3.</i></p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PATTLE,</p>

    <p>A committee Meeting of our Council has been summoned for the
    day after to-morrow (May 5) at eight o'clock P.M., at the
    Beaconsfield Club, to consider some important questions
    affecting your Candidature and the plan of campaign to be
    adopted in prosecuting it. I trust that you may be able to make
    it convenient to attend, and shall be glad to receive a wire
    from you to this effect. I may mention to you that I have
    lately heard, in confidence, that Sir THOMAS CHUBSON's health
    is causing considerable anxiety to the Radical leaders here. He
    has attended very few divisions lately, and has offended many
    of the advanced section by his conduct over the Strike
    Subvention Bill, which was backed by the Labour Members. Sir
    THOMAS, however, abstained from the division on the Second
    Reading. It is just possible that, under the circumstances, he
    may decide to apply for the Chiltern Hundreds very shortly, and
    we must be prepared for every emergency.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours faithfully, JAMES TOLLAND.</p>

    <p>It was a confounded nuisance. I had arranged to take the
    BELLAMYS to the Scandinavian Exhibition this afternoon, and to
    dine and go to the theatre with the JACKSONS. Had to put off
    everything. MARY BELLAMY will be dreadfully annoyed. Wrote
    specially to her to apologise and explain. They're sure to get
    that beast POMFRET to take them instead. He's always hanging
    round. Last week he wrote a lot of verse in MARY's Confession
    Album, in this style (I copied some of it out, in order to show
    it to VULLIAMY, who hates him):&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Though, when he's asked his favourite name, a man is
            apt to stare, he</p>

            <p><i>Must</i> answer, if he knows what's what, "My
            favourite name is MARY."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>And this:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>The vice I detest and abhor above all</p>

            <p>Is not dancing four <i>times</i> with <i>you</i> at
            a ball.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>And this, in answer to the question, "What or who would you
    rather be, if you were not yourself?"&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>I'd rather be the rosebud that nestles in your
            hair,</p>

            <p>Or the aunt whose hand you took in yours and pressed
            upon the stair.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>They all admired this slip-slop immensely, and MARY asked
    me, when I called the other day, if I didn't think it
    wonderfully clever. I know, when I wrote my answers in her
    album, it took me days of thought to get them done in prose,
    and even then they turned out the most ordinary, commonplace
    things. However I thought they pleased MARY, and now POMFRET
    steps in with his confounded rhymes. Mrs. BELLAMY's father once
    published a volume of verse, and is still talked of in the
    household as "your grandfather the poet." She told me that she
    thought "a faculty for versification was the mark of a truly
    refined and delicate mind." Bah! POMFRET's one of the most
    selfish and calculating ruffians outside a convict prison, and
    always haggles over his luncheon bills at the Club, till the
    head-waiter and all the rest nearly go off their heads.</p>

    <p>However, I had to come to Billsbury, nilly-willy. Met the
    Committee after dinner. They were anxious that I should do some
    canvassing soon, and wanted me, when next I spoke, to explain
    myself more fully (1) on the Temperance Question and the
    question of Compensation to Publicans; (2) on the Women's
    Suffrage Question; (3) on the Labour Question; (4) on Foreign
    Policy; and (5) with reference to the Billsbury Main Drainage
    Scheme. I said I would, but I should probably require more than
    one speech to do it in. Afterwards a very solemn member of the
    Committee, whose name I forget, got up and made a long speech,
    in which he observed that my habit of appearing in dress
    clothes at the meetings had annoyed a good many of my
    supporters, and that he ventured to suggest to me, for my own
    good, that I should wear ordinary dress. It seems a good many
    of the lower lot thought it looked uppish. I'm glad enough not
    to have to do it any more. There were other points, but I'm too
    tired to remember them. By the way, I have subscribed to about
    a dozen more Clubs and Institutions, and have promised to get
    Mother to open a bazaar here at the end of the month. Back to
    London to-morrow. What a life!</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>The Kennel, Barks, Friday, May 15</i>.&mdash;This entry
    in Diary is dated from my ancestral home, pleasantly situated
    in the County I have the honour to represent. Haven't been to
    Westminster this week. Hear, through usual channels of
    information, that House adjourns to-day for Whitsun Recess.
    When I say House, I mean fragment that remains; a few doors and
    chimneys, with here and there a ruined wing. Fact is, majority
    absent with influenza. Some seventy or eighty of us have formed
    House of our own; meet regularly at usual hour; get through
    business in a way that would astonish the residuum left at
    Westminster; and jog off comfortably for dinner. All Parties
    and all sections of Party represented. SPEAKER and Chairman of
    Committees still stick to Westminster. But we have GORST, one
    of the Deputy-Speakers, who presides with dignity and despatch.
    JACKSON looks after arrangement of business. AKERS-DOUGLAS
    whips up the Conservatives, assisted by SYDNEY HERBERT and
    ARTHUR HILL. THOMAS ESMONDE brings up to the scratch TANNER,
    SWIFT MACNEILL, and PIERCE MAHONY. On Treasury Bench MICHAEL
    BEACH sits in place of OLD MORALITY, being supported by GEORGIE
    HAMILTON, STUART WORTLEY, and JAMES FERGUSSON, whilst KNUTSFORD
    and DERBY look down from Peers' Gallery. On Front Opposition
    Bench Mr. G., just arrived; finds JOHN MORLEY, OSBORNE AP
    MORGAN, KAY-SHUTTLEWORTH, and MUNDELLA. WOLMER not yet arrived,
    but daily expected. Meanwhile JOHN LUBBOCK, MUNTZ, T.W.
    RUSSELL, and the Wiwacious WIGGIN here, ready to obey the Whip,
    when issued.</p>

    <p>CHARLES FORSTER, looks after petitions for us; FRANK
    LOCKWOOD draws us out (or in, as the case may be); ALGERNON
    BORTHWICK throws an air of fashionable society around us; the
    Reverberating COLOMB lifts his tall head in our midst; ISAAC
    HOLDEN never tires of telling the fascinating story of how he
    discovered the lucifer-match; HENNIKER HEATON passes the time
    writing letters to RAIKES, and complains that the
    Postmaster-General has his communications ostentatiously
    fumigated before opening them; SEYMOUR KEAY says he must get
    back to Westminster (nobody says him nay), or Land Bill would
    be getting passed through Committee; and here is the Grand
    Young GARDNER <i>and</i> his wife&mdash;Lady WINIFRED, of
    course, looking down on us from Ladies' Gallery.</p>

    <p>Have on the whole a very good time. Looked after by RUSTEM
    ROOSE, whose cure is as alluring as it is infallible. "Eat,
    drink and sleep," he says. "Lie on your back and sedulously do
    nothing." So whilst they storm and fret at Westminster, here,
    in hollow Lotos Land we live and lie reclining. Pleasant to
    hear RUSTEM ROOSE's voice as he goes his morning rounds,
    stethoscope in hand. "A long breath, dear friend: say '74;
    Pommery, certainly if you like; a pint at luncheon and a roast
    chicken. Turn over, dear friend; another long breath; say '80;
    de Lanson, of course, if you prefer it; a pint at dinner with a
    fried sole and a porterhouse steak; or, if you are tired of
    champagne, take a pint of claret with a glass or two of port. A
    long breath, dear friend; say '50; three glasses if '50 port
    won't do you any harm."</p>

    <p>Worst of it is we're all getting better, and shall be back
    to the grind at Westminster after Whitsuntide. <i>Business
    done</i>.&mdash;All taking long breaths.</p>

    <p>THE DIS-ORDER OF THE DAY.&mdash;In the House of Commons on
    the Motion of the First Lord of the Treasury, it was resolved
    that Influenza, M.P., be expelled. Mr. CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN,
    Leader of the Opposition, <i>pro tem.</i>, moved to amend the
    Resolution by adding "at once." This was agreed to <i>nem.
    con.</i> The Serjeant-at-Arms was thereupon ordered to remove
    Influenza. He declined on the ground that if he did he might
    catch it. After some conversation the debate was adjourned.
    Influenza left sitting on Members generally.&mdash;<i>Extract

            <p>When too freely you've dined, or too heavily wined,
            or munched too many walnuts or filberts;</p>

            <p>When your brain is a maze, and creation a haze, then

            <p>You can't sleep a wink, so the question of Drink,
            though you timidly shrink from it, harries you.</p>

            <p>Your wit's in a whirl, as you think, if some girl
            with a <i>penchant</i> for you, ups and marries
            you.</p>

            <p>And ties you for life to the thing called a

            <p>Where, <i>what</i> will you be? And you can't find a
            key to the epoch's chaotic confusion.</p>

            a tyrannic majority</p>

            <p>May "opt" for one day, you're unable to say, and in
            vain you appeal to Authority.</p>

            <p>The Law of the Land is a labyrinth grand, which you
            can't understand, nor can anyone,</p>

            <p>And <i>that</i> is a thought, with delirium fraught,
            an appalling, if 'tis not a penny one.</p>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Now Law, the Old Antic, seems utterly frantic,

            dim deserts of Sentiment wandering.</p>

            <p>Now Reason and Right, hydrocephalous quite, are both
            Della-Cruscan and drivelling,</p>

            <p>Life (barring the fun) like "The Mulberry One,"
            seems a mixture of diddling and snivelling.</p>

            <p>There's LAWSON who jaws on the Abstinence Cause on,
            and would lay his claws on the Nation,</p>

            <p>And put sudden stopper on all that's improper (as
            <i>he</i> thinks) without compensation;</p>

            <p>And then there's Sir EDWARD, who, when he goes
            bedward, must have <i>his</i> reflections
            nightmarish!</p>

            <p>It seems, from such rigs, that our biggest Big Wigs
            are scarcest to govern a parish.</p>

            <p>MCDOUGALL again, is agog to restrain all that gives

            one!&mdash;</p>

            <p>He thinks he's a stayer as Jabberwock-slayer, mere
            Angry Boy he, <i>not</i> a Beamish One!</p>

            <p>These Oracles windy do raise such a shindy, and kick
            such a doose of a dust up,</p>

            <p>One would think without <i>them</i> we were wrong
            stern and stem, and the whole of creation would bust
            up.</p>

            <p>But verily why men should <i>new</i> worship

            <p>(See decision <i>Re</i> JACKSON), take burdens their
            backs on, I can<i>not</i> conceive. It seems stupid</p>

            <p>Beyond all expression to have a "possession" whose
            "ownness" there's desperate doubt of,</p>

            <p>And which (if she's <i>nous</i>) you can't keep

            <i>out</i> of!</p>

            <p>What <i>is</i> "Hymen's halter"? I fidget and

            <p>Yes, that's what <i>I</i> think about Marriage and
            Drink&mdash;if you may call it thought, which with
            frenzy is fraught, and gives me a "head" like bad
            whiskey; whose dread is on me day and night, makes me
            wake in a fright, from visions most solemn of column on
            column of such "printed matter" and paragraph chatter,
            as makes me feel flatter than cold eggless batter upon
            a lead platter&mdash;as mad as a hatter, and who will
            relieve me? Can anyone?</p>

            <p>I tell you it's dreadful to face a whole bedful of
            spectres and spooks (born of papers and books) with,
            most horrible looks, limbs contorted in crooks, and
            bat-wings with big hooks, which haunt all the nooks of
            tester and curtain, and which, I am certain, will drive
            me insane if <i>some</i> one can't explain where the
            mischief we are, 'midst the jumble and jar of factions
            and fads, of crotchets and cads, of Tolstois and

    <p>Owing to recent sentimental legislation, many members of the
    learned profession, to which I have the honour to belong, have
    found their practice becoming (to quote the poet) "small by
    degrees and beautifully less." Times were when I could scarcely
    pass a week in term time without appearing in Court holding a
    consent brief, or armed with authority to move (unopposed) for
    the appointment of a receiver. But that was long ago&mdash;a
    deep contrast with to-day&mdash;when my admirable and excellent
    Clerk PORTINGTON, finds an hour a day ample, almost too ample,
    time for posting up to date my Fee Book. However, occasionally
    a gleam of the old sunshine illumines, so to speak, the
    chambers I occupy, and such a gleam was my retention for the
    Defence in the cause of <i>Quicksilver</i> v. <i>Nore</i>. It
    was a Patent Case, and one of the deepest possible interest. It
    is my good fortune to know the Defendant, personally, and it
    was through his kind offices that the instructions to appear
    for him were left at my chambers. My friend and client (who is
    unjustly said to be eccentric in his habits) has recently
    patented and produced a most important invention, which greatly
    facilitates the retention of dinner-napkins, after those
    useful, nay, necessary articles have been used for the purpose
    for which they are manufactured. Like all really valuable
    inventions, the patent is simplicity itself, the napkin-ring
    consisting of the section of the thicker end of an elephant's
    tusk cut to an appropriate size and hollowed out. It is
    necessary to fold the dinner-napkin in such a fashion that,
    when inserted through the ring, its shape is retained by the
    adherent properties inseparable from the ivory. The patent can
    also be produced in other materials, such as gold, silver and
    jewels for the wealthy, and in bone, tin and even glass for
    purchasers of smaller means. I must say that when the ring was
    shown to me I was greatly struck with the cleverness and
    simplicity of the idea, and could not understand how Mr.
    QUICKSILVER could have allowed himself to be so badly advised
    as to bring an action for infringement, merely on the strength
    of <i>his</i> patent being also a dinner-napkin-holder with the
    ring element so far introduced that it consisted of a circle
    closed and opened by a hinge. However, it was no part of my
    duty to advise the other side, so I set to work to get up my
    case (as I invariably do) <i>con amore</i>. I hunted up all the
    causes in the Digest, that seemed to be on all-fours with the
    matter in dispute, and spent days in the Public Library of the
    Patent Office searching for patents having to do with
    table-napkins. As the specifications were not consecutively
    published, I had to wade through a large number of these
    interesting documents that treated of other subjects. For
    instance, the first specification I would take out of the box
    in which it was kept, would perhaps have to do with
    house-raising without disturbance to the foundations, the
    second would prove to be an article half umbrella, half
    revolver, while in the third I would perhaps find an extremely
    quaint notion for a portable pocket corkscrew. I myself picked
    up many ideas for future use, and hope some day, if I do
    nothing else, at least to perfect a clever little contrivance
    of my own for arousing the inmates of a house invaded by
    burglars by casement concussions. I propose calling this
    valuable little instrument (which is founded to some extent on
    the simple construction by which the figures in a child's box
    of wooden soldiers are enabled to advance and retire in a
    scissors-like fashion), when produced, the Policeman's Upper
    Floor Window Tapper.</p>

    <p>The day for the hearing at length arrived, and, armed with a
    mass of carefully selected information, I was in my seat ready
    to defend the originality of the Nore Napkin Ring, so to speak,
    to the death. In my notes before me I had the skeleton of a
    really fine oration, which I felt (if I mastered my normal
    nervousness) would bristle with epigram, and thrill with
    heartfelt, brain-inspired eloquence. So deeply interested was I
    in the matter, that I scarcely listened to my friend's opening,
    and only became aware of what was happening in Court by the
    rising of the Judge. Suddenly his Lordship bowed, and
    disappeared. I looked at the clock&mdash;it was only
    noon&mdash;and, consequently, an hour and thirty minutes in
    advance of the time usually selected for the mid-day
    adjournment. And then, to my dismay, I found that his Lordship
    was suffering from the influenza! Well, there was nothing to do
    but to collect my papers, and, assisted by PORTINGTON, return
    to my chambers. The next day my head ached violently, and I
    could not move. Then I have a recollection of dictating to my
    wife long telegrams to PORTINGTON, which I subsequently
    discovered were neither despatched nor delivered.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
